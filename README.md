Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

Code I was given developed the game world for the agent/pirate to live in. This included the its environment, the way it moves, and a neural network model. The code I focused on was a Q training implementation which goal was to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. To achieve this i needed to determine the optimal number of epochs to achieve a 100% win rate.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer science is an insanely large/broad group of learnning. Thei main areas of focus center around designing, developing, and maintaing software, hardware, and networks that power everything from our smartphones to supercomputers. Computer scientists drive inovation through creating new technologies that improve our lives, garner economic growth, and help solve real-world problems/ challenges. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When approaching a problem it's important to define the problem clearly, by identiying goals and gathering requirements. I need to analyze existing solutions through reseach or through peer learning then develope a solution by choosing the best algorithms and or data structures while considering trade offs with different approaches. Finally I should implement the solution through developing the product and throughly testing and debuging it, and from there just keep itterating and optimizing as I try to improve any measured performance.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

For end users I need to be cautios of their privacy, security, accessibility, and user experience while trying to be as transparent as possible. For my organization I need to maintain integrity in their ethical standards and values while maintaining the confidentiality of any sensitive information or secrets. I also need to respect the intellectual property rights of the org while maintaining my own professionalism in keeping compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
